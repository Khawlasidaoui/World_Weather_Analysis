### Overview
PlanMyTrip is an app that allows users to find travel destinations, nearby hotels and possible itineraries between chosen cities based on their weather preference. Below is a summary of the steps used in the code: 

1. Generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap to retrieve weather data for those cities.

2. Retrieve customer weather preferences, and use them to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

3. Use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
